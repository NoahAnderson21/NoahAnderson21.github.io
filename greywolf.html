Grey Wolf is a Leadership camp that me and my friend Jude Adams staff at. Its main goal is to teach essential everyday leadership skills 
to young scouts. In hopes that they bring back what they have learned to there host troop. And to also applicate those skills into every day life 
to better themselfs at things like public speaking and conflict resolution.
