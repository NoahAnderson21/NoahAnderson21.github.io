KBNG is the school news for STMA High school I have been in the class for the past three years and it has helped shape and build me as a person. 
The course is put on by a fanominal teacher who some how is able to deal with the caos that is KBNG. I couldn't have asked for a better four years 
of learning than what Mr. O was able to provide for me and my friends he truly is a once in a lifetime teacher teaching a once in a lifetime class with people
who try there best everyday to produce something beutiful that many people take for granted.

Supermilage is a activity put on by Scott Danialson where you are able to build a go-kart style car and race it at Brainerd International Raceway. It was something that I accidently got into 
and never intended to become a part of it like I am today.

This is a absolutly toxic show that was produced by KBNG that involved me as the main charetor that was somehow allowed to air to the whole school and got a cult like following from some of its fans (Jan).
