Trap Shooting

                    <p>
Trap Shooting is a sport that I have participated on over the past four years of my attendance at STMA highschool.
It is a rapidly growing sport within the highschools and colleges. And many colleges are also giving out scholarships for it now to wich are fairly easy to attain.

Grey Wolf is a Leadership camp that me and my friend Jude Adams staff at. Its main goal is to teach essential everyday leadership skills 
to young scouts. In hopes that they bring back what they have learned to there host troop. And to also applicate those skills into every day life 
to better themselfs at things like public speaking and conflict resolution.

KBNG is the school news for STMA High school I have been in the class for the past three years and it has helped shape and build me as a person. 
The course is put on by a fanominal teacher who some how is able to deal with the caos that is KBNG. I couldn't have asked for a better four years 
of learning than what Mr. O was able to provide for me and my friends he truly is a once in a lifetime teacher teaching a once in a lifetime class with people
who try there best everyday to produce something beutiful that many people take for granted.

Supermilage is a activity put on by Scott Danialson where you are able to build a go-kart style car and race it at Brainerd International Raceway. It was something that I accidently got into 
and never intended to become a part of it like I am today.

This is a absolutly toxic show that was produced by KBNG that involved me as the main charetor that was somehow allowed to air to the whole school and got a cult like following from some of its fans (Jan).
